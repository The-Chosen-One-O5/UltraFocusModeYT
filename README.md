# UltraFocusModeYT - Study Like a GIGACHAD! 🗿
Hey there, fellow knowledge seeker! Welcome to UltraFocusModeYT, the ultimate tool to help you crush your study sessions without getting distracted by cat videos or that one TikTok rabbit hole. Built for students who want to level up their focus game, this web app turns YouTube into a distraction-free study buddy. Let’s break down why this is your new go-to!

# What’s the Vibe? 🌟
Imagine this: You’ve got a playlist of YouTube lectures or tutorials, but instead of wasting time skipping ads or drifting off, you’re locked in like a total GIGACHAD. UltraFocusModeYT strips away the nonsense and keeps you on track with a slick dark mode interface, a built-in Pomodoro timer, and some clever features to keep your brain in the zone.

# Features That Slap 🔥


# 1. 50-Minute Pomodoro Magic ⏳
What’s Pomodoro? It’s a fancy way of saying “work hard, then chill.” You focus for 50 minutes straight (that’s the sweet spot for brainpower), then get a break to recharge. We’ve baked this into the app:
50 Minutes Focus: Pop in up to 3 YouTube video URLs, hit "Start Focus Mode," and boom—you’re in the zone for 50 minutes.
15-Minute Break: After crushing it, you get a 15-minute breather to grab a snack or scroll memes guilt-free.
10-Minute Break: After the next 50-minute grind, you get a quick 10-minute break, then it loops back. It’s like a study rhythm that keeps you sane.
Why It Works: Studies show 50 minutes is perfect for deep focus without frying your brain. The breaks? They’re your reward for being a boss.

# 2. Alerting Audio to Keep You Honest 🎵
The Deal: We’ve got this dope focus.mp3 track that blares if you dare switch tabs during a focus session. Think of it as your personal hype man yelling, “Yo, get back to work!”
How It Works: Tab away? The audio kicks in, and if you’re signed in, you lose 10 points per distraction. Stay focused, and it stays quiet—your choice, fam.

# 3. Points System for the Win 🏆
Earn Points: Finish a 50-minute session? Bam, +100 points in the bag. Get distracted? -10 points per tab switch. It’s like a game where winning means you actually learn something.
Sign In: Create an account to track your points across sessions. Flex those numbers to your study crew!

# 4. T to Switch Videos 🎥
Quick Swap: Got multiple videos queued up? Press T (or t) to slide out a sidebar with thumbnails. Click one to jump to it—no mouse fumbling required. It’s fast, it’s smooth, it’s you staying in control.

# 5. Ad-Free & Dark Mode 😎
No Ads: We don’t care about cash—we care about your focus. No annoying ads here.
Dark Mode: Easy on the eyes, perfect for late-night grind sessions. Save your peepers for the big exam day.



# How to Use It 🛠️
Hit "Get Started": Sign in or create an account to track points (optional but dope).
Drop Your URLs: Paste up to 3 YouTube video links (lectures, tutorials, whatever).
Start Focus Mode: Click the button, go fullscreen, and let the 50-minute timer roll.
Stay on Task: If you tab away, focus.mp3 will call you out, and you’ll lose points. Stay strong!
Enjoy Breaks: After 50 minutes, chill for 15, then 10 after the next round. Repeat ‘til you’re a genius.
Switch Videos: Press T to pick a new video from your list on the fly.
