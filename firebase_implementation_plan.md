# Firebase Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to implement Firebase as the primary storage with localStorage as a fallback for the UltraFocusMode application.

## Current State Analysis
1. Firebase is already partially implemented with authentication and basic data storage
2. The application currently uses localStorage for all data storage
3. Google Sign-In is already implemented but needs to be positioned correctly

## Implementation Steps

### 1. UI Changes
- Add Google Sign-In button below local sign-in form in v2/index.html

### 2. Data Storage Functions
Modify the following functions to use Firebase as primary storage with localStorage as fallback:

#### saveTasks Function
- Try to save tasks to Firebase first
- If Firebase fails or is unavailable, save to localStorage

#### savePlaylistsToUserData Function
- Try to save playlists to Firebase first
- If Firebase fails or is unavailable, save to localStorage

#### loadSavedState Function
- Try to load state from Firebase first
- If no Firebase data is found or Firebase is unavailable, load from localStorage

#### saveState Function
- Try to save state to Firebase first
- If Firebase fails or is unavailable, save to localStorage

#### restoreTasks Function
- Try to load tasks from Firebase first
- If no Firebase data is found or Firebase is unavailable, load from localStorage

#### populatePlaylistSelect Function
- Try to load playlists from Firebase first
- If no Firebase data is found or Firebase is unavailable, load from localStorage

## Firebase Data Structure
The application will use the following Firestore structure:
```
users/{uid}/
  app/
    state (document containing all user state data)
  tasks/ (collection of task documents)
  playlists/ (collection of playlist documents)
```

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
- Log errors but don't break the application flow
- Gracefully fallback to localStorage when Firebase is unavailable

## Testing Plan
1. Test Google Sign-In functionality
2. Test data saving to Firebase
3. Test data loading from Firebase
4. Test fallback to localStorage when Firebase is unavailable
5. Verify data consistency between Firebase and localStorage

## Rollback Plan
If issues are encountered:
1. Revert to previous localStorage-only implementation
2. Maintain Firebase authentication if working
3. Preserve existing user data

## Dependencies
- Firebase SDK (already included)
- Firebase configuration (already present)
- Existing authentication implementation
