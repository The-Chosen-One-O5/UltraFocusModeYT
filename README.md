Hey there, fellow knowledge seeker! Welcome to UltraFocusModeYT, the ultimate tool to help you crush your study sessions without getting distracted by cat videos or that one TikTok rabbit hole. Built for students who want to level up their focus game, this web app turns YouTube into a distraction-free study buddy. Let’s break down why this is your new go-to!

# What’s the Vibe? 🌟
Imagine this: You’ve got a playlist of YouTube lectures or tutorials, but instead of wasting time skipping ads or drifting off, you’re locked in like a total GIGACHAD. UltraFocusModeYT strips away the nonsense and keeps you on track with a slick dark mode interface, a built-in Pomodoro timer, and a ton of clever features to keep your brain in the zone. Now with streaks, stats, levels, and more—it’s a full-on focus powerhouse!

# Features That Slap 🔥
# 1. 50-Minute Pomodoro Magic ⏳
What’s Pomodoro? It’s a fancy way of saying “work hard, then chill.” You focus for 50 minutes straight (the sweet spot for brainpower), then get a break to recharge. We’ve baked this into the app:

50 Minutes Focus: Pop in YouTube video URLs (up to infinity now!), hit "Start Focus Mode," and boom—you’re in the zone for 50 minutes.
15-Minute Break: After crushing it, you get a 15-minute breather to grab a snack or scroll memes guilt-free.
10-Minute Break: After the next 50-minute grind, a quick 10-minute break, then it loops back. It’s a study rhythm that keeps you sane.
Why It Works: Studies show 50 minutes is perfect for deep focus without frying your brain. The breaks? They’re your reward for being a boss.
# 2. Alerting Audio to Keep You Honest 🎵
The Deal: A dope focus.mp3 track blares if you switch tabs during a focus session. It’s your personal hype man yelling, “Yo, get back to work!”
How It Works: Tab away? The audio kicks in, and if you’re signed in, you lose 10 points per distraction. Stay focused, and it stays quiet—your choice, fam.
# 3. Points System & Levels for the Win 🏆
Earn Points: Finish a 50-minute session without distractions? Bam, +80 points. Complete an entire playlist? +150 points! Get distracted? -10 points per tab switch. It’s a game where winning means you actually learn something.
Level Up: Rack up points to climb epic ranks—each with its own vibe and style. See your level glow at the top-right corner and flex your progress!
Sign In: Create an account to track your points across sessions. Flex those numbers to your study crew!
# 4. Levels - Climb the Ranks Like a Legend 🌟
